## What it does
NoticeMe.AI allows users to easily retrieve and monitor specific tweets with the click of a button. Tweets that are deemed by the system to have a negative sentiment are displayed to the user. This can allow users to detect troubled individuals and cries for help that otherwise go unnoticed.
## How we built it
We made heavy use of the Google Cloud Platform, both for Firebase and Google Cloud's Sentiment Analysis API. Flask was used for the middle-tier and React was used for the front-end. Additionally Twitter's Tweepy API was used. Lastly we are using DigitalOcean to collectively develop in a Linux environment and host our web application on the cloud.
<p><b>What each technology was used for:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Firebase: Firebase's authentication and realtime database were used to create and manage users as well as their data</li>
<li>Google Cloud's Sentiment Analysis API: this API was used for categorizing tweets in terms of their emotional weight</li>
<li>Flask: Python Flask was used as a middle-tier to handle requests from the front-end to Tweepy and Google Cloud</li>
<li>React: React, with the help of Material-UI was used to build a clean and responsive front-end</li>
<li>Tweepy: Tweepy was used to search Twitter for tweets</li>
</ul>
